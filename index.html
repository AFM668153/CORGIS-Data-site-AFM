<p> This data used is taken from the <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/index.html">CORGIS data project</a> regarding the statistics following video games made between the years 2004 and 2010 collected by Dr. Joe Cox.</p>

<p> Some of the more interesting statistics in the taken data is if the said title is a part of a franchise, allowing the marginal profits to be sorted by single titles or franchise titles. This is an important factor to income judging by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises"> the most sold video game franchises</a> and how sequels affect sales. </p>
