   <h1> CORGIS Video Games Data Work </h1>
  <p> This data used is taken from the <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/index.html">CORGIS data project</a> regarding the statistics following video games made between the years 2004 and 2010 collected by Dr. Joe Cox. The data may have greatly fluctuated fom 2010 to present, as games are highly replayable and continue to be sold years after release, but with this data we can get an idea of each games release sales.</p>

  <p> Some of the more interesting statistics in the taken data is if the said title is a part of a franchise, allowing the marginal profits to be sorted by single titles or franchise titles. This is an important factor to income judging by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_game_franchises"> the most sold video game franchises</a> and how sequels affect sales. </p>
  
  <p> A data key that may be unfimilar to some is a games numerous playtimes, with five different data types revolving around the amount of time spent with each game, including Average, Leisure, Median, Polled, and Rushed. Each of these represent the amount of time needed to play through the game at 5 different paces, varying from Leisurely to rushed. </p>
